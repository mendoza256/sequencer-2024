# Sequencer Application

This repository contains the source code for a Sequencer application built with React and Tone.js.

## Overview

The Sequencer application is a music sequencer that allows users to create and manipulate sequences of musical notes. It uses the Tone.js library for audio synthesis and manipulation.

## Main Components

Sequencer: This is the main component of the application. It maps over a scale of musical notes and creates a Track component for each note. It also includes a Lamps component and a TransportSection component.

Track: This component represents a single track of the sequencer, corresponding to a specific musical note.

Lamps: This component is used to display the status of the sequencer.

TransportSection: This component contains controls for starting, stopping, and manipulating the sequencer.

## Setup

To set up the application, clone the repository and install the dependencies with npm install. Then, start the application with npm start.

## Usage

To use the sequencer, select a note from the track and adjust the settings in the transport section as desired. The sequencer will play the sequence of notes according to the settings.
